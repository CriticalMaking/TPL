We're going to compare population growth between 2011 and 2016 (which is originally taken from the 2016 Census - [more info here](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&TABID=1&B1=All&Code1=3520005&SearchText=toronto)). There are plenty of interesting features of this dataset that you might consider using instead of population - language concentrations, income, citizenship, etc. We've already cleaned and processed the population data so it will play nice with QGIS.
