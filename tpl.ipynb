These are a few important pieces that you'll want to set up:  \n\n-   Make sure you have a working Python installation! Download Anaconda and follow its setup instructions if you don't already have a Python installation: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n-   You will need to install the following Python libraries: pandas, numpy, stat, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly. If you are using Anaconda, use \"conda install -c anaconda *package-name*\" from a command line. Alternatively, use pip or easy<sub>install</sub> or apt-get install python-*package-name*.\n-   There is a difference between Python 2 and 3. You may need to familiarize yourself with it, depending on which version you decide to install.\n-   Download and set up JupyterLab and/or Jupyter Notebook: [https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)\n-   Download Blender if you don't already use 3D modeling software (e.g. Maya): [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/)\n-   Download QGIS if you want to create maps and other geospatial data representations: [https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# Data Sources\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We will be using data from the City of Toronto's portal, but there are various other interesting datasets that you might consider working with. For example, you can collect and use your own biometric/self-tracking data if you have a wearable device like a fitbit. Kaggle provides lots of awesome datasets (the pokemon one is fun if you're working with kids): [https://kaggle.com/datasets](https://kaggle.com/datasets). Google has a dataset search tool: [https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch). 538 has plenty of interesting political, social, and sports-related datasets: [https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/). You might also familiarize yourself with the Open North community: [https://github.com/opennorth](https://github.com/opennorth).\n\nThere are various tools you can use to clean/munge/prepare your data, including Excel, Libre Office Calc, R, and many more. We prefer pandas, a Python library for data analysis. There are lots of great tutorials that will outline how to import and prepare data with pandas in an iPython/Jupyter notebook. Your best bet is to do the free datacamp tutorials if you're completely new to this stuff: [https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python)\nThat said, we recommend either starting with something simple or spending plenty of time familiarizing yourself with a dataset in a spreadsheet application before moving to pandas dataframes (even though we have included some very basic cleaning functions in the notebook cells below). \n\nFor this exercise, we will be working with pedestrian data from the King Street Pilot Project. We scraped all the data from the monthly .pdf reports that city of Toronto has made available here: [https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/king-street-pilot/data-reports-background-materials/](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/king-street-pilot/data-reports-background-materials/)\nThe data is available in the *data* directory of the repository that contains this file.  \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n# Working with Data in a Python/Jupyter Notebook\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Start by importing the necessary libraries:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport stat as st\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["If you want, you can set a default figure size for charts:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [10, 8]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next, import your data.

There are plenty of interesting features of this dataset that you might consider using instead of population - language concentrations, income, citizenship, etc. We've already cleaned and processed the population data so it will play nice with QGIS. The raw and processed .csv files are in the *data* directory. \n\n**If you're going to use Excel or Calc to prep data for import into QGIS, here are some important steps:**\n\n-   read this about setting up data for QGIS [http://www.qgis.nl/2012/07/13/koppelen-van-data-uit-csv-bestand/?lang=en](http://www.qgis.nl/2012/07/13/koppelen-van-data-uit-csv-bestand/?lang=en)\n-   similar to the steps used with the King dataset, you'll want to cut the row you want and paste special into a new document, transposing the row into a column (this can also be done in pandas)\n-   in order to get the appropriate scale in later 3D model, concatenate a decimal and zero to cell and copy down the column (you can also change the shapefile size parameters in QGIS, but that's a taller order)\n-   (right click to) format first column and make sure it has leading zeroes to match the id values in the shapefile\n-   make sure you have a csvt and follow the appropriate formula in current one - refer to this: [https://anitagraser.com/2011/03/07/how-to-specify-data-types-of-csv-columns-for-use-in-qgis/](https://anitagraser.com/2011/03/07/how-to-specify-data-types-of-csv-columns-for-use-in-qgis/)\n\n**Here are some additional things you can do with pandas and numpy:** \n\nDepending on the data you use, you might have to re-scale to make it printable.

Think about how to separate your models into individual, reconfigurable/modular chunks in order to create dynamic data representations. It is easy to 3D print lego-like connectors onto the faces of your objects: [https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=lego+brick&dwh=525baba295ab0da](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=lego+brick&dwh=525baba295ab0da).
