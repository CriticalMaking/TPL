Repository for TPL Open Data Workshop. All instructions are in tpl.ipynb which can be viewed here (without charts) or at http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CriticalMaking/TPL/blob/master/tpl.ipynb (with charts). Plotly charts appear to be messed up in notebook viewer. Will fix at some point. For the time being, you can run the whole notebook on your own machine and they should turn up fine...
